-------- on now ---------
- eligibility: must start in TZ, and end at 6 total escapes

- investigate offset in registration...

------- next up ---------

- make neater, update tests

- place preference (incl. loom expts) pipeline

- speed heatmap plot

- find dlc errors and retrain all videos

- characterize EFFECT OF LASER on POST-THRESHOLD-CROSSING BEHAVIOR: directness to edge;  which edge taken; time to shelter; for threshold crossings: laser vs. no laser (spont threshold crossings in non block EV) vs laser (non block EV); right vs left; trajectories for a certain distance or time

- characterize exploration and effect of laser (e.g. does it change the amount of time spent near edge? The SR (time-discounted prob) of edge from threat zone? do the other laser params?)

- RT as homing run initiation?
