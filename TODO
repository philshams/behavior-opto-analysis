------- at home or work ------


- plot all laser trials of a given condition

- do rendering videos/images once dlc is trained
    - try: colored line plus occasional silhouettes (try matplotlib) w/ onset silhouette as well as RT silhouette (and arrival silhouette?) (and intermittent silhouettes?)

------- at work -------

- train new dlc network (and make a workflow for this)
