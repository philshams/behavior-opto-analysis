------- at home or work ------
- do spontaneous homing analysis (e.g. 9715 did any on left?)
- update tests

------- at work -------
- copy concatenated data, tracking output to hard drive













------- after injecting next group ---------

- do rendering videos/images once dlc is trained
    - try: colored line plus occasional silhouettes (try matplotlib) w/ onset silhouette as well as RT silhouette (and arrival silhouette?) (and intermittent silhouettes?)
    - and/or: mouse at beginning /end of stim, with trail?
    - entire session in one plot?

- try escape initiation as begin of turn-and-run

- plot non-laser control runs

- place preference (incl. loom expts) pipeline

- speed heatmap plot

- find dlc errors and retrain all videos

- rendering size ~ tuple

- quantify directness to edge;  which edge taken; time to shelter; for threshold crossings: laser vs. no laser (spont threshold crossings in non block EV) vs laser (non block EV)
