-------- on now ---------


------- next up ---------

- do rendering videos/images
    - try: colored line plus occasional silhouettes (try matplotlib) w/ onset silhouette as well as RT silhouette (and arrival silhouette?) (and intermittent silhouettes?)
    - RT as escape initiation?
    - entire session in one plot?

- place preference (incl. loom expts) pipeline

- speed heatmap plot

- find dlc errors and retrain all videos

- rendering size ~ tuple, make size vs. video height/width more principled

- characterize EFFECT OF LASER on POST-THRESHOLD-CROSSING BEHAVIOR: directness to edge;  which edge taken; time to shelter; for threshold crossings: laser vs. no laser (spont threshold crossings in non block EV) vs laser (non block EV); right vs left; trajectories for a certain distance or time

- characterize exploration and effect of laser (e.g. does it change the amount of time spent near edge? The SR (time-discounted prob) of edge from threat zone? do the other laser params?)
